<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This project is a working deep learning model which can detect license plates and recognise the text in them in photos , videos and live feed as well.
<ol>
  <li> The project uses yolov5 architecture , specifically uses yolov5m pretrained model and trains it on the custom training dataset.
  <li> You can find the official repository for yolov5 here (yolov5)[https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5] from which this project is changed and trained upon.
  <li> To test this model, you will have first clone the repository mentioned above and include the files mentioned below into the cloned repository.
  <li> You can download my custom trained weights for this model from [custom-weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VNWbHFKWhwuIJGIQeHu48iegcqX4T4Z/view?usp=sharing)
  <li> You can find inference on a test image by the model in this repository (test-image.jpg).
  <li> This repo also contains training-statistics folder which has the statistics , graphs of the training process.
</ol>

## Files to include 
<ol>
  <li> Include the modified detect.py file (detect-modified.py) present in this repo.
  <li> Include the ocr-recognition.py file as well.
  <li> Include the downloaded custom weights mentioned above as well.
</ol>

## Inference
<ol>
  <li> cd into the cloned repository and Execute the following command : 
  <li> python detect-modified.py --source "source image relative path" -- weights "relative path to custom weights " --save-crop
</ol>


## Training
<ol>
  <li> To train your own model you can use look into LicensePlate-train jupyter notebook , which is used to train my model.
  <li> I used a kaggle dataset to train my model , you can find many such datasets on the internet , or you can create your own dataset.
</ol>

## Text Recognition
<ol>
  <li> The  LicensePlate-train jupyter notebook also has code which shows steps to how we are recovering text from the license plate crop using pytesseract.
